# Expectations from Early DevOps Engineers at ColoredCow

Early DevOps hires at ColoredCow play a foundational role. You are not stepping into a fully established vertical — you are helping build it. That means your contribution extends beyond tools and automation. You will help shape how the DevOps function looks, works, grows, learns, and delivers value inside the company and for our clients.

This document outlines what we expect from early members of this vertical — practically, technically, and culturally.

---

## 🌱 1. The Mindset We Look For

### **1.1 Ownership Over Tasks**
You don’t wait for instructions — you take charge of problems, understand the context, propose solutions, and see them through.

### **1.2 Builder’s Mindset**
You prefer building systems and reusable assets over one-off scripts or hacks.

### **1.3 Clarity and Communication**
You explain your thinking clearly, write structured updates, maintain documentation, and communicate proactively.

### **1.4 Entrepreneurial Spirit**
You’re comfortable in environments where not everything is polished.  
Early hires help create the clarity — not rely on others to provide it.

### **1.5 Curiosity + Problem-Solving**
You dive into problems with reasoning, not assumptions.  
You ask “why?” before “how?”

## 🔧 2. Core Technical Expectations

### **2.1 CI/CD Foundations**
- Build, optimise, and maintain CI/CD pipelines  
- Improve speed, reliability, and clarity  
- Write maintainable workflows  

### **2.2 Cloud & Infrastructure Essentials**
- Deploy and manage workloads (AWS preferred)  
- Understand networking, storage, compute, IAM basics  
- Apply IaC (Terraform or CloudFormation preferred)  

### **2.3 Observability & Reliability**
- Configure dashboards, logs, alerts  
- Understand monitoring fundamentals  
- Participate in incident analysis  

### **2.4 Automation & Platform Thinking**
- Simplify repetitive tasks  
- Create reusable modules, templates, boilerplates  

### **2.5 Security & Hygiene**
- Follow best practices  
- Build guardrails (not gates)  

You don’t need mastery of all tools on day one — we value your ability to **learn fast, reason well, and structure problems clearly**.

## 📬 Final Note

This isn’t a role where you just “execute DevOps tasks.”

You will help **build** a vertical, a culture, a set of best practices, and a long-term capability.  
If you enjoy working in environments where your contributions matter immediately — you will thrive here.

If you have questions or want clarity on anything, feel free to open an issue.

Welcome — let’s build something meaningful.
